# **Boston House Price Prediction using XGBRegressor**

This project demonstrates how to predict house prices in Boston using the XGBoost regression model (XGBRegressor). The dataset used is the Boston Housing dataset from scikit-learn, which contains information about various houses in Boston. The goal is to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes (MEDV) based on different features.

**Requirements-**
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:

scikit-learn
XGBoost
pandas
numpy
matplotlib

**This script will:**

Load the Boston Housing dataset.
Preprocess the data (handle missing values, scale features if necessary).
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train an XGBRegressor model on the training data.
Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data.
Make predictions on new data points (example included).
